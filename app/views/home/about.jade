    h2 How does it all work?
    p.
      Our servers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping" type="_blank">scrape</a>
      various websites for the desired information and return it to developers using
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank" title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</a>
      objects, allowing them to use and manipulate it for their own reasons. This
      service creates a lot of opportunities for developers that don't necessarily
      have the know-how to get the data, but full of ideas for using it.
    p.
      If you have an idea that only needs a little more data to become a reality,
      don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:apis@apis.is">contact us</a> or even
      contribute yourself to our <a href="https://github.com/kristjanmik/apis" target="_blank">github repository</a>.

    h3 What about version control?
    p.
      At the moment, including an <code>accept-version</code> header is not
      necessary, since all endpoints are at version 1, <strong>but we strongly
      recommend it</strong>. Once an endpoint has been updated, the default
      version to be returned is the most recent, and this documentation will be
      updated accordingly. Changes in functionality between versions will be
      listed specifically.
